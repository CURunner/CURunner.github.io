          <h2>Download FlashBuild 3D an app I made to use the Object Capture API and Photogrammetry.</h2>
<p>Ever wanted to create 3D objects just from pictures of images? With my new FlashBuild 3D app, you can easily make 3D objects with the new Object Capture API from Apple on Mac. This app is simple and easy to use. After installing simply select a folder full of images taken of an object and before you know it you will have a 3D usdz file! </p>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flashbuild-3d-object-capture/id1615133492">Download FlashBuild 3D for Mac</a>
<p>Please note that this app requires either an Apple Silicon chip or a discreet GPU.</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<h3>Taking Photos</h3>
<p>For best results. TAKE AT LEAST 20 PHOTOS (MORE IS BETTER). Try to place the object you are taking photos of on a solid background. Slowly move (or rotate if on turn table) around the object taking photos of it at different angles with about 70% overlap. Try to have good lighting too. When you are finished taking photos. Send the photo's to your mac and put them all in one folder that way you can select them in FlashBuild.</p>
<a href="../assets/good3DObjectPhotosExample.zip" download>Example of Good Object Capture Photos. (Feel free to test the app with these).</a>
<p>-For your first object. Try setting the quality level to low for a faster processing time. If you are happy with the results, a higher quality setting will take longer but yield a better looking model.</p>
