      <h2>Challenge 5: Accessibility Concerns</h2>
      <p>One of the accessibility concerns that I found was that without an addition of a homepage it may be hard for the user navigate back home to the main page (the index.html page). I was able to add that in. Additionally, a viewer might not understand why there is a forurm to fill out due to this page having other elements such as a chessboard among other things. This page is also likley not suitable for dark mode. Additionally, I am not sure how the page would look on mobile devices as I've only tested on desktop.</p>
