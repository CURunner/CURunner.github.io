    <h1>NFT's Explained using Car Keys</h1>
    <h2>By Jake Derouin</h2>

<h3>What is an NFT?</h3>
    <p>Note: I made this analogy myself (Noah helped me choose to use car keys) and I will probably edit and publish this somewhere.
    
    An NFT is a digital token (think ID card) that is entirely unique. 
    
    In this scenario, the car keys are the NFT 
    
    Imagine that you have a set of car keys that let you drive a specific car. The car has unique features, such as heated seats, built in water dispensers for athletes running by, and a sporty look that all of your friends are jealous of. The car also has a unique serial number (VIN) that no other car has. 
    
    The keys you have are unique so that only the person who owns the keys can drive the car with the exact same serial number. The keys are also irreplaceable.  
    
    Now let’s say down the road (pun intended) your car appreciates in value (it was a rare limited edition Nike Coach vehicle) and you decide you want to sell your car. To sell your car you list your car keys online. As soon as someone buys the keys from you, you immediately lose access to the car as you no longer own the keys to drive it.
    
    
    This analogy sounds very similar to how one would use and sell a car in real life. That is exactly how NFT’s work except all of the items involved are entirely within the digital world.

   <h3>Digital items?</h3>
   <p> 
    Now for an NFT lets say the car keys are a digital license with a serial number to use a limited edition special sword (the Flubber Blade) in the new hit zombie video game, Hollywood Apocalypse by Metaphore inc. The Flubber Blade gives its owners a huge advantage over other players so much so that Metaphore inc. is only selling 100 Flubber Blade licenses for $1000 a piece. 
    
    Anyone who has possession of the Flubber blade license can use the Flubber Blade until they decide to sell the license to someone else (for real money).  
    
    Let’s say I as college student, I spend way to much of my time playing Hollywood Apocalypse. I end up buying one of their Flubber Blades to use. When I purchase the Flubber Blade, a transaction occurs on the blockchain (more on this later but essentially this means that it is impossible for fraud to occur). 
    
    Now, a few years down the line, I decide that I am done playing Hollywood Apocalyspe and while I will never get the countless hours back from wasting time in the game, I will be able to get back some money I spent paying for the Flubber Blade since I own it as an NFT.
    
    Because my NFT Flubber Sword License was so rare (only 100 were made) my NFT appreciated in value and is now worth $5000. I can sell my NFT and make some money. By selling the NFT I lose access to the Flubber Sword within the game and someone else gains access to the sword.
    
    
    To sum it up:
    In nearly all video games today buying video game gear such as special swords is a purchase that you cannot resell at a later time. In the physical world, if I buy something, I can sell it later. But if I buy a sword in Fortnite, I give Epic Games Inc. my money and can never sell the sword, I am stuck with it forever. NFT’s change that in that they allow ownership and transfer of ownership in the digital world and this can go beyond games too. This is why NFT’s are a big deal in addition to the fact they are built on the blockchain. But all of the examples you hear about are people selling hyperlinks to images of something like Justin Bieber’s foot on the internet for millions of dollars. This is because people don’t have legitimate uses for NFT’s at this time (few games currently let you buy gear as NFT’s) but there is so much excitement around the idea (and crypto investment is the new form of gambling) that people are willing to pay ridiculous prices for ridiculous things because they dont understand the purpose but its making people rich. Now on the subject of crypto and blockchain what the heck do NFT’s and the blockchain have in common. 
    
    
    NFT’s transactions occur on the blockchain (typically the Ethurium blockchain) which means they are subject to the same security and fraud resistant system that crypto currency transactions are.

    <h3>Blockchain transactions: </h3>
    <p>
    Continuing the car analogy, blockchain can be compared to a Carfax report of a car. A carfax report is a public document tied to a specific car’s VIN number (serial number) that lists all of its previous owners, service history, accidents etc. The information on the car fax report can be seen by anyone who is interested. Carfax is controlled by a company responsible for verifying the authenticity of vehicle owner transfers. 
    
    Because Carfax is controlled by a single organization, a hacker could theoretically break into the companies database and fraudulently modify carfax reports. Perhaps they could also break into the governments vehicle registration database and change records of who owns a specific vehicle. While this is very unlikely to happen, this is impossible on a system like the blockchain.
    
    The Flubber Sword NFT as discussed earlier, can be thought of to have a carfax report (called a ledger). Anyone at anytime can find out who owns a specific Flubber sword NFT and a history of transfers in ownership.
    
    Unlike a Carfax report who’s authenticity is attested by a single organization the records of an NFT transaction authenticity are attested by MILLIONS of computers (crypto miners) not controlled by a central body. 
    
    When an NFT is transaction is started (I buy a Flubber Sword from someone), information about the transaction is uploaded to the internet to the public ledger. This new transition then read by ALL of the computers participating in crypto mining. 
    
    This transaction includes information such as (this is simplified):
    
    -The sender’s address (crypto wallet address) I.e hifnisj342fgdsg
    -The receiver’s address i.e t45by5i4t3biu4
    -The item being traded.
    -The value of the trade.
    -Gas fee (Gas is an amount of crypto that is required to make a transaction). This gas fee is how crypto mining computers who will verify the transaction make money.
    -Other information
    
    Now once this transaction is uploaded to the Etherium network (the network is comprised of millions of computers), computers (miners) do math to ensure that this transaction is valid.
    The term blockchain refers to the fact that every transaction (ever made on the blockchain not just from the Flubber Sword) is a block that is connected mathematically to the previous block (transaction). Through the use of some complex math that is beyond me, a computer could go through the entire chain of transactions (blocks) and calculate specific information about the next block. If one block is changed fraudently (such as I attempt to trade an NFT that I do not own), the chain breaks in that the math used to calculate each block no longer makes sense and the transaction is rejected.
    
    This verification of transactions is done by millions of computers world wide not controlled by one organization. If a few computers (miners) tries to verify fraudulent transactions, as long as at least 50.01% of computers (miners) reject those fraudulent transactions, it is impossible for this fraud to occur. 
    
    Once a transaction is verified (my purchase of the Flubber Sword), that record of ownership transfer is public to the internet forever. Anyone can go back and see that transaction. 
    
    Below I drew a diagram of a simplified example of a transaction on the blockchain.
