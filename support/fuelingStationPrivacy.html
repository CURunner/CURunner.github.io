<h2>Crash Data</h2>
<p>
    If you have opted into sending crash reports on your device, if the app ever crashes, some crash data will be sent to Jake to help fix app bugs. This data is completely confidential and has no personal information attached.
</p>
<h2>Automatic check in</h2>
<p>
    The fueling station app supports automatic check in to check you in without opening the app. For this feature to work you must enable always allow for location services. Even though always on location is required to enabled, no GPS data is used. Instead, your device listens for the presence of a Bluetooth beacon located in the fueling station. When the presence of the beacon is detected, you are check in. Your location information is not stored or accessed in any way.
</p>
<h2>Gold card integration</h2>
<p>
    The fueling station app lets you link your Gold Card account (provided by the Flatiron Meal Plan) with the app for easy balance checking. When you link your account your Gold Card username and password are saved locally to your device. Your Gold Card password is encrypted with AES encryption when it is stored on your device to protect it at rest. When you refresh your balance, your device logs into your Gold Card account on the Flatiron Meal Plan website. Because the app interacts with the Flatiron Meal Plan website, their privacy policy is also worth reading.


</p>
<h2>Nutrition Notes</h2>
<p>
    Your nutrition notes are stored in on your device and are not accessible by anyone other than yourself. 
</p>
<p>
    This privacy policy is subject to change. By using the CU Buffs Fueling Station app you agree to this policy. If you do not want to use this app to check in, the staff offer a kiosk system for you to check in manually.
